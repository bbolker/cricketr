* implement general cross-validation stuff
    * kappa, binary-bias measures
	* RMSE, bias measures
	* allow different resource table predictors (optfun, raw table ...)
	* RMSE: prediction depends on whether game ended early (i.e. team 2 won); need to rescale resources accordingly
* more pictures: 
    * ggplot_tile capacity
	* combo capacity (do we need a restab.list or a merge-restab functionality?)
