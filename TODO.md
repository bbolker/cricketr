* import scraping code
* implement general cross-validation stuff
    * kappa, binary-bias measures
	* RMSE, bias measures
	* allow different resource table predictors (optfun, raw table ...)
	* RMSE: prediction depends on whether game ended early (i.e. team 2 won); need to rescale resources accordingly
* code for extracting stopping distribution/averaging over it	
* more pictures: 
    * ggplot_tile capacity
    * combo capacity (do we need a restab.list or a merge-restab functionality?)

## Low priority

* consider making a fake database for general distribution
